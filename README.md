# python-challenge
The python challenge is used to show knowledge gained in using python to read csv files, perform analysis with the data and then output the results into a text file. 

The first challenge PyBank was to perform analysis on a companyâ€™s monthly profit and loss records to determine the total profit/loss over the entire period, the average of changes and the greatest increase and decrease in profits.

The second challenge PyPoll was to perform analysis on a small rural towns election to determine the number of votes each candidate received and to determine the winner.
